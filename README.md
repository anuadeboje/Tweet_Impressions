# Tweet_Impressions
The goal of this project was to create a process or application that could quickly describe the
major topics or themes and summarize sentiments in tweets reacting to the launch of Beyond
Meat & KFCâ€™s plant-based chicken nuggets. This type of real time real world feedback informs
stakeholders with the early opinions and judgements of the new product that might be difficult to
get in a market research setting.
